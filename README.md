# Rust Ray Tracing in a Weekend

This project is an implementation of the "Ray Tracing in a Weekend" series by Peter Shirley, adapted to the Rust programming language. The original series guides readers through building a simple ray tracer from scratch over a weekend using C++. This Rust adaptation follows the same concepts and progression but utilizes Rust's features and syntax.

## About

Ray tracing is a rendering technique used to generate realistic images by tracing the path of light as pixels in an image plane and simulating how it interacts with virtual objects. "Ray Tracing in a Weekend" provides a hands-on introduction to ray tracing, making it accessible even to those with minimal experience in computer graphics.

## Features

- Implements basic ray tracing concepts such as rays, vectors, and surfaces.
- Supports rendering spheres, diffuse materials, and simple lighting.
- Utilizes Rust's features for memory safety and performance.

## Current Phase

This project is currently in phase 1, following the concepts introduced in the first book of the "Ray Tracing in a Weekend" series.

## Getting Started

To run the project:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Rust installed on your system.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Build and run the project using `cargo run`.
